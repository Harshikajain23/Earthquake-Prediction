# Earthquake prediction
Accurately predicting earthquakes is crucial for mitigating their impacts on human lives and infrastructure. Despite advances in seismology, the complexity of seismic activity makes reliable prediction challenging. This project aims to develop an earthquake prediction model using machine learning techniques on a dataset of Indian earthquake records from 2018 to 2021, analyzing attributes like date, time, location, depth, magnitude, and source to identify predictive patterns.

By leveraging data preprocessing and machine learning algorithms, this project seeks to enhance prediction accuracy. The goal is to provide a tool for early warnings and improved disaster preparedness, contributing to the safety and resilience of earthquake-prone communities. This effort aims to advance seismology and offer practical solutions for earthquake risk mitigation.

Different models - Linear Regression, SVM and Random Forest have been applied on the Indian_earthquake_dataset and their results have been compared.
